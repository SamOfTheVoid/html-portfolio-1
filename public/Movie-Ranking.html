<h1>Sam's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>The top three films ever, as recognized by yours truly</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>Honestly, what's not to love? This film is a classic by nearly anyone's standards.</p>
<h3>The Ladies' Man</h3>
<p>Maybe a little crude by today's standards, but Tim Meadows is absolutely hilarious.</p>
<h3>Multiplicity</h3>
<p>An underrated comedy classic from the 90's. Michael Keaton plays four of the funniest parts of his career.</p>
